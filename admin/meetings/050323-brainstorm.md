## Agenda Items
- Thinking about ways to contribute to code base evenly

### Ideas
- Sizing down Tarot card portion
  - maybe a smaller deck? less cards?
  - allows us to divide into multiple teams
  - maybe a Tarot card portion and a 8-ball/crystal ball portion (more developed solution from previous)
- The scale of the Tarot card solution is appropriate for a full scale project
  - Can add complexity to welcome page and other interactions to divide coding work amongst team members

### Necessary Features
- Shuffling is the main ceremony of card reading, builds suspense
- All cards are fanned out, and 3-card spread is selected 

### Potential Features
- Can begin with top of deck selection, if time permits can select individually from deck (could both be randomized anyways)
- Starting Page
  - Maybe allow user to select type of fortune telling?
  - Otherwise, can have a simple start menu w/ a welcome page
    - Ex: Maybe entering a circus tent
