### Takeaways
- Development in teams can be difficult without same time availability
- Need to keep code style in mind during development, to save time afterwards

### Sprint 2
- Code 1 will develop a settings/options area
- Code 2 will continue to develop cards page, specifically with producing responses/data
  - Considering how/when we want to retrieve generated data vs. pull from local array/bank
  - Also potentially use localStorage to prevent repeating responses to the same user
