- Brainstorm ideas the fortune telling project

### Ideas
- Tarot cards
    - Alexis will digitally design the cards
    - Alternative way to select cards:
        - Randomize 3-4 groups of cards.
        - Have User pick one of the decks.
        - Flip over the cards and depending on the cards the position of cards gives answer.
- Pixel/8-bit Game theme
    - Mood: pink, calming, happy

### What makes a good fortune teller?
- Positive answers (confirmation bias)
- Mention some specific characteristics of user
- Good Visuals, differentiation between different deck of card, like choosing a crystal instead of number
- Give advice that could help with the result
- Sound effects

### What makes a bad fortune teller?
- Shitty
- Not accurate at all
- Lack of ethics
- The answer that create stress and anxiety
- Answers seem off-topic and unrelated to user's queries (unresponsiveness)

### Necessary Features
- Adding an "About" Section for users to learn more about our method of fortune telling, with resources to more information
- A start screen that won't advance until the user indicates that they are ready to proceed.

### Potential Features
- Adding a Crystal Ball Portion of the App by repurposing the 8-ball application we made at the beginning of the quarter
    - Give it the ability to do math (easy work with coding)
    - Make it be able to tell the time
    - Potentially adjust responses based on different factors (time of day, user input punctuation, etc.)
    - Add sound effects and and like Background Music to the overall product?
- Adding Flip Animations to the cards so the user feels increased engagement when they select their fortune
- Adding Sound Effects to the overall product would also increase user engagement
- Introduction on each tarot card
