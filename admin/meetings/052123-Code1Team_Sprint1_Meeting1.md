## Agenda Items
- Implement computer screen page Issue #11
- Implement video transition Issue #12

## What we accomplished
- Implemented the computer screen image as the starting page
- Added the transition video to fit the dimensions of the computer screen image
- Created a button that plays the video and sets the page to the blank computer screen image for team 2 afterwards

## Issues encountered
- The button currently moves relative to the window size rather than the computer image, so it moves from where it is intended
