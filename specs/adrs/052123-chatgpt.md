# Use of ChatGPT

## Context and Problem Statement
- Need to define how we intend to use ChatGPT
- To what extent can we utilize (and trust) the results/code from ChatGPT?

## Details
- From the 8-ball exploration project, we understand both the capabilities and drawbacks of ChatGPT
- Want to use ChatGPT sparingly in order to control the quality, readability, efficiency, etc. of our code.

## Decision Outcome
- ChatGPT will be used sparingly in the appropriate situations to help the development process, specifically in cases where large-scale generation may be required (i.e. building tarot card responses). However, we will continue to keep close watch on the quality of our code in order to maintain a high standard.
